    <h1>${name}</h1>
    <p>
        Squirrel was born from the idea of creating a <i>simple</i>, <i>fast</i>, and <i>modern</i> web framework.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is built with cutting-edge technologies like <a href="https://deno.com">Deno</a> and <a href="https://webreflection.github.io/uhtml/">µHtml</a>.

        I believe in the power of talented individuals loosly cooupled working together, in a loosely coupled way, rather than relying on large software teams.
    </p>
    <p>
        Just like a chef needs the best ingredients to prepare a great meal, a developer needs the best tools to craft exceptional software.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Web framework come and go</b>, but <b>standards</b> (like HTML5, CCS3, SVG, ...) stay.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is a approach to have a small footprint over standards.
        Compared to other frameworks which are heavy and complicated.
    </p>

    <h3 class="mt-2">Why Deno?</h3>
    <p>Deno is the modern Node.js which is simple and secure.</p>

    <h3 class="mt-2">Why µHtml?</h3>
    <p>µHtml is very small and effecient library. It does not need a complicated virtual doom and still is fast.</p>
