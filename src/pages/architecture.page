    <p>This is brief description about the architeture of Squirrel.</p>

    <h3 class="mt-2">Backend and Front</h3>
    <p>
        Squirrel uses Server-Side-Rendering and Front-Side-Rendering.
    </p>

    <p>
        The server renders the most of the HTML and this can he cached.
        And then it lets <b>holes</b> in the page for dynamic content that could
        be fill with content on the front end.
    </p>

    <p>
        Current there is a support for uHTML front end component, but basically
        you can use any other framework that suppor to render into a single
        div-tag.
    </p>
