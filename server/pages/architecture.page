    <p>This is brief description about the architeture of Squirrel.</p>

    <h5 class="mt-2">Backend and Front</h5>
    <p>
        Squirrel uses Server-Side-Rendering and Front-Side-Rendering.
        Squirrel's key is to combine static with dynamic content.
    </p>

    <h5 class="mt-2">Brief with history</h5>
    <p>
        In the beginning with rendered everything on the server.
        THen with have a little bit dynamic with javascript.
        Then Microsoft invented XMLHttpRequest to download data
        from server on the fly and the stone started to role.
        Then we ended in huge frontside rendering frameworks
        like Vue, Angular, React and so own. They invented the
        virtual DOM to manage the rendering performance. Now
        we are back on server side rendering for static parts
        of the page and dynamic holes or island on the front end.
        Even we can combine everything we need. Server rendering
        could be cached for static rendering, but also can be dynamic
        on the backend and Dynamic in the frontend. If you let the
        technolgy open, people would be creative to fill there needs.
    </p>




    <p class="mt-8">
        The server renders the most of the HTML and this can he cached.
        And then it lets <b>holes</b> in the page for dynamic content that could
        be fill with content at the front end. So the key is the combination of
        both world server and front rendering.
    </p>

    <p>
        Current there is a support for uHTML front end component, but basically
        you can use any other framework that suppor to render into a single
        div-tag.
    </p>
