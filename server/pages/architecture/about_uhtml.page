    <p>
    <a href="https://webreflection.github.io/uhtml/" target="_blank">uHtml</a> (micro µ html) is one of the <b>smallest, fastest, memory consumption</b> friendly,
    yet zero-tools based, library to safely help creating or manipulating DOM content.
    </p>

    <p>
    It is entirely <b>Web standards based</b> and it adds just the minimal amount of spices
    to the templates literals it’s able to understand and optimized for either repeated
    updates or one-off operations.
    </p>

    <p>
    This page describes, without going into too many details, all the features delivered
    via this module which is roughly 2.5K once minified and compressed, or even bundled
    within your project.
