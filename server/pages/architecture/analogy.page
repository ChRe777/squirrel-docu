    <h4 class="mt-2">Analogy to the anatomy of a human body</h4>
    <p>
        We have <b>bones</b> that provide stability and <b>muscles</b> that allow flexibility.
        Both, in combination, make us highly robust in interacting with the world.
        Without bones, we'd be like jelly, and without muscles, we wouldn't be able to move.
    </p>

    <p>
        We have muscles and bones working together because they serve complementary
        functions that allow us to move, support our bodies, and interact with
        our environment effectively.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><b>Bones</b> provide structural support and form the rigid framework of our body. They protect vital organs, store minerals, and serve as attachment points for muscles. Without bones, we would lack shape, support, and protection for our internal systems.</li>

        <li><b>Muscles</b>, on the other hand, are responsible for movement. They contract and relax to generate force, which moves the bones at the joints. Muscles give us the ability to perform actions such as walking, lifting, and grasping.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Together, muscles and bones create a system that allows for <b>mobility</b> and <b>stability</b>.
        The bones provide the structure and leverage for muscle action, while muscles enable
        movement and provide the force necessary to move the bones. This synergy allows us
        to interact dynamically with the world, balancing <b>stability with flexibility</b> and <b>adaptability</b>.
    </p>

    <h4 class="mt-8">Analogy to reinforced concrete</h4>

    <p>
        Reinforced concrete is a material of <b>concrete</b> and <b>steel</b>.
        The concrete is for compression, and the steel is for tension.
        Both in combination makes the material very robust.
